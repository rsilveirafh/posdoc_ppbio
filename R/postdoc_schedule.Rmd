### Main project

1. Routine Revision
	+ Gather species lists of biological groups
		- Amphibia (Adrian) + first group as pilot
		- Birds (Henrique)
		- Crocs (?)
		- Fishes (?)
		- Lizards (Guarino)
		- Mammals (Hernani)
		- Snakes (ThaÃ­s)
		- Turtles (?)
	+ Naming correction and updates
	+ BOLD Systems
		- Open API
		- Q1. Are there differences in results in BOLD Systems between searches using "group + country" or "species"?
		- Q2. What are the main used genes?
		- Q3. What is the percentage of species that have been sequenced and are in BOLD Systems?
    + GBIF trait and spatial information
		- Open API
		- Q4. Are there enough information about species (IUCN and GBIF)?
		- Q5. Are there good gene information based on biomes?
		- Q6. Are there good gene information based on altitude?
	+ IUCN status, spatial and trait information
		- Token requested, waiting for response
	+ NCBI
		- Is it worth it?
	+ Money investiment
		- Q7. Which biological groups had investiments to barcoding? (mammals 2015)
		- Q8. Which biomes had investiments to barcoding?
	+ Gathering the whole database to cloud (SQL?, PostgreSQL?)
